# TypeScript Project

Boilerplate for a project built in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and running in [Node.js.](https://nodejs.org/)

## Getting Started

1. Degit the repo

```shell
npx degit MCluck90/ts-node-project#main
```

2. Search for and replace the following:
   1. `ts-node-project`
   2. `<YEAR>`
   3. `<COPYRIGHT HOLDER>`
   4. `<DESCRIPTION>`
   5. `<AUTHOR>`

3. The integrated terminal is set to "cmd" to [get around an issue with using Git Bash](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/35593). If you don't use Git Bash, remove this setting.

## Usage

### Run the application

```shell
$ npm start
```
